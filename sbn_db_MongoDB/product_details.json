However, for me, the negatives are that it is not a powerful enough cleanser to clear away all makeup.  Two washes are required, so this becomes a longer cleansing process. Despite whether I am washing away foundation based or mineral powder based makeup, it does not cleanse sufficiently with one wash.  I have therefore gone back to another brand for evening cleansing and only using Decleor for morning cleansing.","stars_num":3},{"review_date":"17/01/2016","review_header":"super cleaning milk","review_comment":"has a great smell and texture - not oily and cleans off make up really well leaves your skin soft and smooth ready for the next step.","stars_num":5},{"review_date":"15/01/2016","review_header":"Lovely scent!","review_comment":"I have been using this for over a year and saw the deep discount on strawberry.net recently and got myself another salon sized bottle!

It offers very high protection for outdoor activities (e.g. playing sport, walking around/lazing at the beach, hiking in the mountains), so this sunscreen can be used for 'outdoor' activities and not only for 'everyday' use. The cream feels heavier than normal sunscreens designed for everyday use and so it should - due to the fact that this is a more potent cream. The SPF rating of 30 is quite adequate - of course the SPF 50 in this range will offer higher protection but I think the SPF30 cream for this particular brand is highly effective.","stars_num":4}]]},{"product_url":"https://www.strawberrynet.com/en-us/skincare/dermalogica/ultracalming-super-sensitive-shield/142015/","brand_name":"Dermalogica","product_name":"UltraCalming Super Sensitive Shield SPF 30 ","product_price":"60.50","review_num":0,"avg_stars":0,"review_details":[]},{"product_url":"https://www.strawberrynet.com/en-us/skincare/la-roche-posay/anthelios-xl-50-unifying-compact-cream/186671/","brand_name":"La Roche Posay","product_name":"Anthelios XL 50 Unifying Compact-Cream SPF 50+ - # 02 ","product_price":"28.00","review_num":0,"avg_stars":0,"review_details":[]},{"product_url":"https://www.strawberrynet.com/en-us/skincare/biotherm/auto-bronzante-face-self-tanning/184941/","brand_name":"Biotherm","product_name":"Auto-Bronzante Face Self-Tanning Serum ","product_price":"31.00","review_num":0,"avg_stars":0,"review_details":[]},{"product_url":"https://www.strawberrynet.com/en-us/skincare/biotherm/creme-solaire-spf-15-uva-uvb-melting/168364/","brand_name":"Biotherm","product_name":"Creme Solaire SPF 15 UVA/UVB Melting Face Cream ","product_price":"19.50","review_num":2,"avg_stars":5.0,"review_details":[[{"review_date":"23/07/2018","review_header":"Biotherm Creme Solaire SPF15","review_comment":"Love Biotherm products which are extremely hard to get hold of in the U.K.  This sun cream is excellent, especially for anyone with sensitive skin - well it works for me anyway.
